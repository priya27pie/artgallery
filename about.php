                    <h5>Hand-painted</h5>
                    <p>Our mission is to provide you with the best service, to be in tune with your requirements and to anticipate your needs. Our reputation is based on the fundamental virtues of competence, coherence and reliability, and we provide a high level of expertise in: interior design, renovation and real estate (home hunting). OUR STRENGTH is that we offer unknown or new materials that are not visible on the market. If the material is common, we will not present it to you because you can already see it everywhere. We are interested in originality. Our promise is to bring the best level of expertise to your project, and for that Valerie Barth has chosen to deploy a team throughout France. Sticking to a limited geographical area did not provide all the talent we needed; so we went to look for them elsewhere </p>
